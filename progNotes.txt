Found bugs:
zombie flying off when shot
zombies can rotate while walking and then will no longer walk on the ground (in extrem cases the can walk 90 degree to the ground)
when hold some weapons the gun/arms are below the camera
Held Bullet count doesnt change until the weapon has been reloaded (so unitil the weapon is reloaded it will display the old number of bullets held)
current ammo count isnt changed until a bullet is shot
colliders aren't the same as the mesh on some of the floors
